# EventChain  
Decentralized Event Ticketing App

EventChain is a blockchain-based event ticketing platform that leverages NFTs, smart contracts, and a mobile-first architecture to eliminate ticket fraud, ensure transparent ownership, and enable secure event entry verification.

---

## 1. What is EventChain ?

EventChain is a decentralized event ticketing system where event tickets are issued as **ERC-721 NFTs** on the **Polygon blockchain**. Each ticket is uniquely owned, verifiable on-chain, and protected from duplication or manipulation.

### Key Goals
- Eliminate ticket fraud and duplication  
- Provide transparent, on-chain ticket ownership  
- Enable secure peer-to-peer ticket transfers  
- Ensure trustless event entry verification  
- Reduce reliance on centralized ticketing platforms  

### Core Features
- Blockchain-backed NFT tickets (ERC-721)  
- Flutter-based mobile application  
- Firebase-powered authentication and off-chain storage  
- QR-code based ticket validation  
- Organizer dashboard and entry scanner  
- IPFS-based NFT metadata storage

## 2. Setting up Flutter on Your Device ?

### Prerequisites
- Windows / macOS / Linux
- Git
- Android Studio or VS Code

### Flutter Installation Steps

1. Download Flutter SDK  
   https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install

2. Extract the SDK and add Flutter to PATH

   ```bash
   export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`/flutter/bin"

3. Verify Flutter installation

    ```bash
    flutter doctor

4. Install required platform tools

- Android Studio (Android SDK + Emulator)
- Xcode (macOS users for iOS)

5. Accept Android licenses

    ```bash
    flutter doctor --android-licenses

Once all checks pass, Flutter is ready to use.

### 3.3 Firebase Setup

1. Create a Firebase project
2. Enable Firebase Authentication
3. Enable Firestore Database
4. Download google-services.json / GoogleService-Info.plist
5. Configure Firebase in Flutter
6. Initialize Firebase in main.dart

Firebase is used only for:
- User authentication
- Event listings and metadata
- Wallet-to-user mappings

Ticket ownership and validation are handled only on-chain.

### 3.4 Smart Contract Setup
1. Install dependencies

    ```bash
    npm install

2. Compile smart contracts

    ```bash
    npx hardhat compile

3. Deploy contracts to Polygon (Testnet/Mainnet)

    ```bash
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network polygonMumbai

4. Save deployed contract address in Flutter configuration

### 3.5 Running the Flutter Application

    flutter pub get
    flutter run
